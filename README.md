# Honigraumwaage
This project will help me to weigh the honey yield of my bee hives in order to get figures for selective breeding.

In the honey extraction room is a Raspberry Pi which is attached to modified bathroom scale, a keypad and a LCD Display.
The marked honey roomes are weighted; the marking is typed to the numpad and send.
